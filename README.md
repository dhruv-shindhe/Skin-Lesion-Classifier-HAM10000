# Skin-Lesion-Classifier-HAM10000

Classification of 7 types of skin Lesions namely:
1.	Melanocytic nevi
2.	Melanoma
3.	Benign keratosis-like lesions
4.	Basal cell carcinoma
5.	Actinic keratoses
6.	Vascular lesions
7.	Dermatofibroma


For this HAM1000 dataset was used ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images").Ham10000 is a collection dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images.
The data set was obtained from here : https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
From the HAM10000 data set we will be using only HAM10000_metadata.csv and HAM10000_images_part1 and HAM10000_images_part2 which have to be unzipped for accessing the images in the folders through the os module 

DataPreprocessing:
Separated directories were created and for train and test data within which 7 directories corresponding to 7 different types of lesions were created.
Test and train were split in the ratio 10:90 i.e 9013 samples in the training set and 1002 samples in test set. Both the folders containing the images(i.e HAM10000_images_part1 and HAM10000_images_part2) were accessed  and their corresponding class was obtained form HAM10000_metadata.csv ‘dx’ column and were copied into their respective folders(one of the 7 classes ) in the respective directories (train or test)


Model:
This is a simple Lenet model with 3 conv layers and 3 maxpool layers.
Here the validation set was the same as the test set 
The model gave an accuracy of around 74% in the test set, 20 epochs was taken with anything more the more was seen to overfitting 
The graphs below give the loss and accuracy in the training and validation set 

  
Improvements :
1.Different validation and test set
2.Data augmentation
3.Tranfer learning using MOBILENet
